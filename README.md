# EPL's Wire EDM Wire Power Supply (WPS)

A high-efficiency power supply unit designed for Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) applications. The design is based on the Rack Robotics Powercore V3 and owes much to their engineering efforts.

## EPL Contributions

The EPL has reworked a few aspects of the Rack Robotics Powercore V3 for use in it's CNC-Type Wire EDM. Primarily, we've made use of 2.54mm pin headers in place of the spring-based connectors, or Pogo pins, to simplify construction without the enclosure. Other modifications have been made the the firmware project structure, separating sensor drivers, boost converter, fault handling, and other portions of the project into a modular C++ library.

## DEVICE INTERFACES

![Powercore V3 Device Interface Diagram](images/powercore-v3-device-interface-diagram.png)

### POWER INPUT CONNECTOR

Input power connects via 2-position lever-action Wago connector accepting 16 AWG conductors. 48VDC input must be connected before applying 5V via USB-micro. If USB power is applied before 48VDC input, the microcontroller enters fault mode.

### POWER OUTPUT CONNECTOR 

Output connects via 2-position lever-action Wago connector accepting 16 AWG stranded conductors. Output cable must be twisted pair, <1 meter length, and either shielded/grounded or contained within a shielded/grounded enclosure.

### DIGITAL INTERFACE CONNECTOR 

4-position JST-XH header provides communication with external controllers. Exposes 3.3V and GND from RP2040 microcontroller with current-limiting resistors.

- **Enable Input**: Output is enabled when this input is connected to 3.3V or external 3.3V supply with common ground. 10kΩ pull-down resistor to GND.
- **Feedback Output**: Reports EDM power consumption via active-low PWM signal. 100% duty cycle indicates no power consumption from machining; 0% indicates short circuit. Maintain 10-90% duty cycle during machining by adjusting feedrate. 10kΩ pull-down resistor to GND. External low-pass filter can convert to analog feedback.

### USB-MICRO SERIAL INTERFACE

Exposes USB-micro connector of RP2040 Pico module for parameter configuration and telemetry. Default baud rate: 115,200.

**Warning**: Device requires both 48VDC input power AND 5V USB power. 48VDC must be connected first, or device enters fault mode.

## THEORY OF OPERATION

The Powercore V3 generates controlled electrical discharges for EDM machining. The system cycles through spark initiation, current delivery, and discharge termination at high frequency (5-20kHz).

**Spark Initiation Voltage**: Determines spark formation conditions. Higher voltages create longer, more intense discharges suitable for harder materials.

**Machining Duty Cycle**: Controls discharge duration. Longer duty cycles increase material removal rate but may increase surface roughness.

**Machining Frequency**: Sets discharge repetition rate. Lower frequencies can increase material removal rate but may reduce surface finish quality.

**Machining Current**: Ranges from 40A to 70A, determined by fixed 48VDC output during current phase and combined impedance of output cables and discharge gap. Current is not user-adjustable.

## OPERATION MODES

### STARTUP BEHAVIOR 

On power-up, output is disabled (high-impedance state). Power management module initializes and pi-filter capacitors charge to 48V with inrush protection. Brief audible noise (~1 second) is normal during startup. Output current sensor calibrates and serial communication establishes.

**BOOST CONVERTER SELF-TEST**: System tests boost converter module and I2C digital potentiometer. If I2C communication fails, device reports 'ERROR: DPOT is not at expected position'. 

During startup, digital potentiometer cycles through settings 0-110, generating boost converter output voltage lookup table (50V-160V). If voltage range is insufficient, device enters fault mode and reports 'ERROR: DPOT voltage range is less than expected'.

Normal startup sequence via serial:
```
Setting DPOT to minimum position...
Waiting for voltage to stabilize...
Reading voltages for DPOT lookup table...
Boost Converter Digital Potentiometer Voltage Table:
0: 51
1: 52
...
109: 161
110: 166
```

Successful startup indicated by solid green LED and "Setup complete" message. Device enters IDLE mode.

### IDLE MODE

Output remains in high-impedance state until enable input is asserted (3.3V). No discharges occur in idle mode.

### ISO-FREQUENCY MODE

Fixed-frequency discharge mode. Default mode or activated via 'EDM_ISOFREQUENCY_MODE' command. Enable input must be asserted (3.3V) to begin operation.

**ISO-FREQUENCY MODE PARAMETERS**

| PARAMETER | Min | Default | Max | Unit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Machining Duty Cycle | 1 | 10 | 10 | % |
| Machining Frequency | 5,000 | 1,000 | 10,000 | Hz |
| Spark Initiation Voltage | 64 | 80 | 100 | V |

### EDGE-DETECTION MODE

Probe mode for detecting electrode-workpiece contact via PWM feedback. Intended for setup and calibration only, not for machining. Activated via 'EDGE_DETECTION_MODE' command with enable input asserted.

## APPLICATION EXAMPLE: MINIMUM IMPLEMENTATION

![Powercore V3 Minimum Implementation](images/powercore-v3-min-implementation.png)

Minimum system configuration:

| Connection | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| Power Input | 48V, 300W supply via 16 AWG stranded wire |
| USB-Micro | 5V supply or PC connection. **Note**: 48V must be connected first |
| Enable Input | Connect to 3.3V after power supplies are connected |
| Power Output | Positive (+) to workpiece, negative (-) to electrode (wire/tool) |

## EMC & EMI

The Powercore V3 power supply unit is housed in a precision-machined, billet-aluminum enclosure, fully grounded to minimize electromagnetic interference. When no output cables are connected, radiated emissions are negligible. However, when output cables are attached, radiated emissions vary based on cable characteristics, including length, twist, and wire gauge.

**Requirements**: Output cables must be shielded, grounded, and twisted. Poor cable design may increase emissions and interfere with sensitive equipment.

**Installation**: Complete machining setup should be enclosed, shielded, and grounded. EMC compliance is installer's responsibility.

## Typical PSU Waveforms

### Output Stage Switch Control
Normal behavior of output stage switches during EDM iso-frequency mode. The enable (yellow trace) and high-current phase (red trace) switches are both active at the same time, permitting current flow from the positive electrode to the negative electrode. The high-voltage switch is active several microseconds before each switching event, for the purpose of charging the output capacitor to the spark initiation voltage (blue trace).

![Powercore V3 Waveform 1](images/powercore-v3-waveform-01.png)

### Gap Voltage with Electrodes Separated
Normal behavior of output stages during EDM iso-frequency mode, with the electrodes separated by several millimeters under distilled water. The positive (+) electrode (red trace) shows the change in gap voltage when the output capacitor is charged and then slowly discharged through the water.

![Powercore V3 Waveform 2](images/powercore-v3-waveform-02.png)

### EDM Discharge Behavior
Normal behavior of output stages during EDM iso-frequency mode, during electrical discharge machining. The positive (+) electrode voltage changes rapidly during an EDM discharge; transitioning from the spark initiation voltage (here 80V) to the gap machining voltage (~40V) in several hundred nanoseconds.

![Powercore V3 Waveform 3](images/powercore-v3-waveform-03.png)

![Powercore V3 Waveform 4](images/powercore-v3-waveform-04.png)

### Boost Converter Operation
Normal behavior of the boost converter module. The MOSFET gate (blue trace) presents with short pulses, which are used to maintain a stable output voltage. The output voltage will be set by the I2C digital potentiometer to between 64 and 150 V.

![Powercore V3 Waveform 5](images/powercore-v3-waveform-05.png)

Startup behavior of device. Two seconds are required for inrush protection and serial communication initiation. Subsequently, the boost converter and output voltage sensor collaborate to create the lookup table for the I2C digital potentiometer. Once the lookup table is constructed, the boost converter is set to its default 80V setting.
